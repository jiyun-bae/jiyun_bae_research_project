## Plan for Research Project

I tried to complete the project using minimal functions so that it could be easily applied to the roku later. The roku design that our team is working on is a form where you can listen to videos and music on a simple background, so the colors are different, but it is slightly reflected. As a result of research, I found that multimedia access using html and js is the easiest way to access me, and I applied it to the project.

## Path for Research Project

1. Install NPM
2. Build html, js 
3. Create App page with socket
4. Design a page with SASS
5. Check insect if everything working and TA-da!
